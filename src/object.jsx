        <p>With loops, you can execute a sequence of instructions over and over again for a set pre-determined number of times until a specific condition is met.</p>
        <p className='py-3'>There are two types of loops in Python:</p>
        <code>for loops</code>
        <code>while loops</code>
        <p className='py-6'>To solve the LeetCode problem "TwoSum" you will need to use a for loop</p>
        <p>Here is a for loop in action</p>
        <code>Array = [2, 3, 4 ,5]</code>
        <code>for n in Array:</code>
        <code>      print(Array[n])</code>
        <p>The following will be printed to the console:</p>
        <code>2</code>
        <code>3</code>
        <code>4</code>
        <code>5</code>
